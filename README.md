 The Power of Plots

In this repository, I examine data from a study of different drug regimens on mice with tumors. 

After the data is merged and cleaned, we're able to examine various statistical measures of the tumor volumes associated with each regimen, as well the aggregate measures of all regimens combined. 

We're also able to compare the number of measurements taken for each regimen throughout the study and examine the gender dstribution in the mouse population of the study.

We then examine each mouse's tumor volume at the point of their final measurement.

After running further statistical analyses on the data, we can use a boxplot to visually compare the final tumor volume per regimen of several drug regimens of interest within the study.

Lastly, via scatterplots, we're able to gain a clearer understanding of the relationship between the average weight of the mice on a particular regimen and the volume of their tumors and calculate the correlation coefficent of that data to make that relationship very clear.
